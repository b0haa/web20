  <h1>Extraction</h1>

<img src="wweew.jpeg" alt="Loading..." class="center">

  <p>“Extraction” climaxes with an intense, well-staged gun battle on a bridge blocked by Amir’s henchmen. We get a brief flash of this action at the beginning of the film, with Rake taking several bullets and dragging his bloody body across the concrete. When we return, we’re privy to a slight pivot toward a different character with the film’s tragic hero and Nik Khan finally taking up arms instead of just being Rake’s eye-in-the-sky. We also get a muddled grasp at irony and a final shot that’s an absolute cheat. No matter what we’re getting at any given time, it’s always punctuated by bullets whizzing through flesh and explosions warping buildings and vehicles.
